Week 2 Required Discussion

<strong><em>You must post your comments (start a new thread) before you can read/reply to other threads….</em></strong>

Your reading this week from the “Practical Guide” focuses on initiating an EA program.

1.1.  If I were in an executive position with your organization, why would it be so important to gain my “buy-in”? What arguments would you give to convince me that initiating an EA program is worth it?

1.2. What are some of the primary benefits and challenges associated with initiating an EA program?

1.3. What benefits could be derived by assigning a Chief Architect to the EA program?

Then, as a <strong><u>separate discussion</u></strong><u> topic</u> (non-graded, but required for Participation credit).
